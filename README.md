# Crop-Nutrient-Deficiency-Detection



🔍 **What it does:**  
A web-based application that detects **nutrient deficiencies in rice plants** from leaf images using a **YOLOv8 classification model**. Once a deficiency is detected, it leverages **Google’s Gemini LLM** to generate expert-level insights, including:  
- Visual symptoms  
- Impact on plant health  
- Treatment recommendations  

🧠 **Tech Stack Highlights:**  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for image classification  
- Gemini 1.5 Flash for contextual generative responses  
- Flask API + OpenCV for backend and image processing  
- CORS support for frontend integration  

This project not only strengthened my skills in **deep learning** and **LLM integration**, but also gave me a real-world problem to solve with AI.
